# WGPU + EGUI + FPS Camera Template
A ready-to-use template that combines WGPU for graphics rendering, EGUI for user interface, and a first-person camera system. This project provides a solid foundation for 3D applications, game prototypes, or visualizations with minimal setup required.

## Features
- WGPU graphics backend for modern, cross-platform rendering
- EGUI integration for immediate mode GUI elements
- FPS Camera system with mouse look and keyboard movement
- Pre-configured project structure and dependencies

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/0xdilo/wgpu-egui-template.git
    cd wgpu-egui-fps-template

Build and run:
    ```bash
    cargo run -r

That's it! The template should compile and launch, showing an static background with working camera controls and a simple EGUI interface.
